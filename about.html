      <p>World Vision Evangelism Church (WVEC) is a Christian religious institution which had its origins from the Evangelical Mission of Damans Church, also known as Mission Evangelique Damans, in the Democratic Republic of Congo in central Africa. It is founded on the application of the Great Commission from the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 28 - Verse 18-20, which states:</p>
      <blockquote>
        "And Jesus came and spoke unto them, saying, 'All power is given unto me in heaven and on earth: Go ye therefore, and teach all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.'"
      </blockquote>
      <p>During the initial stages of its inception, this great religious institution faced many setbacks, trials, and tribulations. Through the leadership and spiritual strength of our charismatic Bishop, Auguy Ilunga Kabamba, his wife Evangelist Sarah Meta Kabamba, and our wonderful congregation, we were able to weather the storm. By late September 1990, after a period of intense prayers and meditation, we saw a breakthrough and received the vision to establish World Vision Evangelism Church. This vision eventually transformed into an international church with the main goal of bringing and spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ to all peoples of the world. Hence, the reason for establishing a branch in Phoenix, Arizona in the United States of America.</p>
      <p>World Vision Evangelism Church (WVEC) was founded in September 1985 through the spiritual and innovative inspiration of Bishop Auguy Ilunga Kabamba and his wife Evangelist Sarah Meta Kabamba. WVEC is incorporated in the State of Arizona and is recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) non-profit religious institution. Bishop Auguy immigrated into the US in 2001 and decided to establish a branch of WVEC here in Phoenix, Arizona in July of 2007. The congregation of WVEC is very diverse and includes people from different backgrounds and cultures. While the majority are refugees from various West African states, there is a mix of people from different ethnicities, including Whites, Blacks, Asians, Hispanic/Latinos, and Native Americans.</p>
      <p>As one would imagine, each group of these new immigrants came into the U.S with different cultural values and beliefs, as well as different traditions. America, as we know, has her own values and beliefs as they relate to upholding the fundamental rights of everyone in the country.</p>
